Using web scraping to generate reports with statistics about music lyrics.

## Why? 
For fun - really, we just want to know how many times person X has said thing Y.  

## API Keys
For obvious reasons, any API keys used in this project are not kept in the source code, you must add your own to use this project. API keys are stored in a .venv file and loaded upon application initialization, using a package called python-dotenv. 

Simply:

1. Create a file called `.env`
2. Copy the contents of `example.env` into `.env`
3. Fill in the empty fields with your own API information
